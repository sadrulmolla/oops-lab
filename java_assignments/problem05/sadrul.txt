Books are manâ€™s best friends.
Books are portable and so they are easy to carry around.
And so books can be read at any time night or day, while travelling on a bus or train or flight, and at meal time too.
Books are published in many languages and in varied genres.
There are books in fiction and non-fiction categories.
